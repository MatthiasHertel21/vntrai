# Flask Context Fix Summary

## Problem
The "Working outside of request context" error was occurring because the Flask `request` object was being accessed inside the generator function `generate_task_execution_stream()`. When a generator function yields values, the HTTP request context may have already ended, making the `request` object inaccessible.

## Root Cause
```python
# BAD: This was inside the generator function
def generate_task_execution_stream():
    try:
        # ... other code ...
        
        # THIS CAUSED THE ERROR - accessing request inside generator
        if request.method == 'POST':
            request_data = request.get_json()
            # ... more request access ...
```

## Solution
Moved all Flask `request` object access OUTSIDE the generator function, before it's called:

```python
# GOOD: Extract request data BEFORE creating the generator
@agents_bp.route('/api/agent_run/<run_uuid>/task_execute/<task_uuid>/stream', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@csrf.exempt
def api_stream_execute_task(run_uuid, task_uuid):
    # Extract ALL request data here, before generator
    try:
        # Load data and validate
        agent_run = agent_run_manager.load(run_uuid)
        agent = agents_manager.load(agent_run['agent_uuid'])
        # ... validation code ...
        
        # Extract request data OUTSIDE generator
        if request.method == 'POST':
            request_data = request.get_json()
            task_inputs = request_data.get('inputs', {}) if request_data else {}
        else:
            task_state = agent_run_manager.get_task_state(run_uuid, task_uuid)
            task_inputs = task_state.get('inputs', {}) if task_state else {}
        
        request_method = request.method  # Store for later use
        
    except Exception as e:
        return Response(f"data: {json.dumps({'error': str(e)})}\n\n", mimetype='text/event-stream')
    
    # NOW create the generator with all data pre-extracted
    def generate_task_execution_stream():
        # No request object access in here!
        yield from _execute_ai_task(run_uuid, task_uuid, task_def, task_inputs, agent, request_method)
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Thread Locking**: Added proper threading locks to prevent concurrent access to OpenAI threads
2. **Error Handling**: Better error handling for all edge cases
3. **Simplified Cancellation**: Removed complex retry logic that was causing race conditions
4. **Proper Resource Cleanup**: Added `finally` blocks to ensure locks are always released

## Test Results
- ✅ Thread lock mechanism works correctly
- ✅ Context prompt building works without Flask context
- ✅ Variable resolution works properly
- ✅ Generator simulation completes without context errors
- ✅ No more "Working outside of request context" errors

## How to Verify the Fix
1. The Docker container should start without context errors
2. Task execution should work normally
3. No more "Working outside of request context" messages in logs
4. Multiple concurrent requests should work without conflicts
